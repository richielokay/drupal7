<h2>Feed a Fever</h2>

<p>Conventional wisdom be damned, Fever needs fuel to burn. 
<?php if (isset($show_opml_msg)) : ?>
Import your feeds from an existing OPML below and be sure 
to d<?php else : e('D'); endif; ?>rag this <?php e($this->feedlet_link()); ?> onto your 
browser bookmark bar. The feedlet allows you to subscribe 
to any feed embedded in a page.</p>

<h2>Crank up the heat</h2>

<p>In order to get the most out of Fever you need to take 
advantage of Sparks. Your regular subscriptions are like 
kindling. Sparks are feeds that you subscribe to solely to
increase the temperature of the information you are most 
interested in.</p>
